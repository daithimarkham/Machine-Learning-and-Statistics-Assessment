# Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Assessments

Jupyter Notebook containing four assessments which we will be given over the duration of the semester. 

### If you are having problems with Github not displaying the contents of the notebook. 

Sometimes Github will not display the contents of the notebooks. If this happens, copy the url of the notebook page, and paste here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ 

### Task 1. 

- Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and
prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should
not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should
research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.
