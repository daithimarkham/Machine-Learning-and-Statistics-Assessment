# Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Assessment

Jupyter Notebook containing four assessments which we will be given over the duration of the semester. 

### Task 1. 

- Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and
prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should
not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should
research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.
